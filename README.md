Leaf Disease Detection and Classification


Using computer vision and Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN/ConvNet) techniques, many leaf diseases can be reliably detected, therefore decreasing cost, reducing treatment times and misdiagnosis. CNN is able to successfully capture the Spatial and Temporal dependencies in an image through the application of relevant layers. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks along with pre-trained networks like VGG16 and ResNet50 and MonileNetV2 were developed to analyze images of leaves and determine the health of the leaf. This classification was deployed in a web-based application.
